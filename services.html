                    <h2>Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine</h2>
                    <p>Traditional Chinese herbal medicine draws on ancient practices -- herbal medicine is as old as humanity itself. Early human beings were hunter-gatherers whose survival depended on their knowledge of their environment. Direct experience taught them which plants were toxic, which ones imparted strength and sustained life, and which had special healing qualities.</p>
                    <p>These early discoveries were passed along until thousands of years and millions of human trials brought about the evolution of an incredibly sophisticated <a target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/natural-medicine/chinese/traditional-chinese-medicine-diagnosis.htm">system of diagnosis</a> and herbal medicine.</p>
                    <p>They are prescribed either in decoction (cooked in water) or in powders, granules, capsules or tablets. They are most always combined together into a single custom formula that is specific to the patient’s current state and constitution.</p>
                    <p>We have more than 250 standard formulas, each of which can be modified to fit a patient's individual pattern of disharmony. The herbalist or practitioner combines herbs based on the diagnosis, using a traditional herbal formula as a foundation and adding other herbs specific to the individual's complaint and constitution.</p>
                    <p>As the person's health improves, the nature of the imbalance changes, so the herb formula must also change. Some herbs are deleted when they are no longer needed, while others more appropriate to the changing condition are added.</p>
                    <h2>Acupuncture Treatment</h2>
                    <p>Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese Medicine involving the insertion of solid filiform acupuncture needles into the skin at specific points on the body to achieve a therapeutic effect. No drug is injected. The needles alone create the beneficial effects of acupuncture.</p>
                    <p>Acupuncture needles are usually stainless steel(they may also be fold or silver). They are very fine, flexible and rounded but sharp at the tip. They are ‘atraumatic’, meaning that thy do not have a cutting edge like a hypodermic needle, which slices through tissue. Their design allows acupuncture needles to slide smoothly through tissues and makes them unlikely to cause bleeding or damage to underlying structures.</p>
                    <p>Most Acupuncture points are located along energetic pathways called ‘meridians’. These meridians relate to all aspects of our body and mind, they regulate bodily functions as well as thoughts and emotions.</p>
                    <p>Through various diagnostic methods the Practitioner is able to determine where ‘qi’ (or energy) running through them may be blocked, deficient, excessive, or simply where it needs balancing. Stimulation of these points and their corresponding functions leads to improved energy flow and overall balance throughout the body. This allows the body to be better able to heal itself, as well as maintain an increased state of health and vitality.</p>
